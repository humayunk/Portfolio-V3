          <h4 class="two columns offset-by-one column">My Story</h4>

          <h5 class="eight columns">In high-school, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life (surprise, surprise). So I was told to go to business school to "keep my options open." I studied commerce at Ryerson University, majoring in Marketing.
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          While there, a few things happened outside the classroom which helped shape my future decisions. I became a Research Assistant for two consumer behaviour professors, one in particular that was specialized in behavioural economics. It was there that I became fascinated with the works of Daniel Kahneman and devoured books and papers on the topic.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          I also became enamoured with entrepreneurship through my invovlement with a student group that helped launched Ryerson's DMZ. However, upon graduation I became an analyst at a private-equity-owned mid-size business as an analyst.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          I knew that there were green pasteurs elsewhere quickly. A year in, confused and unsure of what to do next, I did what any disgruntled person would do, study to write the LSATS, apply for law school, and find salvage in an otherwise glorified profession. It took two tries and grueling hours of studying but I got score I felt comfortable enough to apply with.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          After being accepted by the University of Ottawa, a month before I was supposed to move to the city and start, I went for a walk with my younger brother and told him I was unsure about law school and didn't really want to go. He replied saying "well, don't." It's funny how that's all it took for me to throw my coveted spot away, which I did.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          Confused once more, I turned to my trusty whiteboard in my bedroom at my parents. I drew a venn diagram and mapped out what I wanted to do next. The three circles were "marketing, writing, and technology." The sweet spot in the middle ended up being an internship at BetaKit covering startups from around the globe.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          It was there a few months later that I discovered my love for product strategy and design, watching documentries like Urbanized, Helvetica, and reading books like Change by Design. Around the same time, the corporate entity that owned BetaKit decided to shut it down (it was later revived.) Having a vague idea of UX design, I had coffee with Satish Kanwar expressing my interest in what his firm did.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          Next thing I knew I had a 3-month contract working as a content strategist at a leading UX agency, writing case studies about their process working with startups and enterprises alike. I learned about what designers did, what developers did, and what a PM was. At the end of 3-months, we were aquired by Shopify for talent.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          There was a natural fit for me to move into the communications department despite my interest in product and design and without the necessary experience to have that conversation, I decided to learn about the world of growth and content marketing. It was at Shopify that I witnessed some of the smartest marketers 10x the company, destroy the competition, and prep for an IPO. However, I still wasn't content. I wanted to design.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          It started with a lynda.com tutorial learning Illustrator after becoming interested in vector illustrations, but grew into designing my own banner headers in Photoshop and eventually creating a infographic for one of our hackathons. But I knew if I was going to be taken seriously, I had to step it up a notch. So I did.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          I took a 3-month part-time "Intro to Design Fundamentals" at HackerYou, a UX-workshop at Springboard, and started learning front-end web development at Thinkful. It just so happneded that all this happened at the same time. And I was working full-time. Needless to say, I was burned out, but equipped to start taking action.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          I hacked together a portfolio one weekend with concept and course projects and started applying for jobs. After a successful interview process, I landed a job as a UX/UI designer at a well-known agency. I learned pretty quickly that design wasn't everything I had imagined as a job. It wasn't all brainstorming and writing on sticky notes and putting them on the wall. But I did get to contribute to two big house-hold name projects in a capacity that I did not expect so early in my career. I learned by doing and it was a lot of trial by fire.</h5>
          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          Unfortunately, I also saw the realities of the agency business and 6-months I saw myself being downsized in favour of contractors and interns. After a month of freelancing and helping a friend bootstrap a weight-loss app, I joined Tiny Hearts after connecting with Robleh, someone I had worked with while at Jet Cooper. </h5>
           <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
          There's been a lot of ups and downs, but as the only full-time designer at the studio, I've been able to help ship multiple studio-initiated products and client projects while helping define the process for how not just to build things right, but how startups and enteprises can go about building the right thing. A year and a half later, I'm still at Tiny Hearts, be sure to check us out.</h5>
