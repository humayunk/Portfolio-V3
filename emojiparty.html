          <h5 class="eight columns">After the successful launch of Next Keyboard by Tiny Hearts, we had a great deal of insight in regards to what people loved about messaging and keyboards. We knew we wanted to dive deeper into exploring the possibilities of what we could do to piggy back on people's obsessions with emojis. We also wanted to do something playful. That's how the game idea came into being. </h5>

          My Role: I was the lead designer and product owner responsible for concepting the interactions, the aesthetics, and then executing to make them a reality.</h5>

          <h5 class="eight columns">Early on, we threw away a lot of ideas of what the grid or collection view would look like, it took my discovery and interest in the app YO! for the look and feel to emerge. I was really intrigued by the bold use of colors, how the app had managed to gain traction, and keep the interactions very minimal.</h5>

          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
           I then started looking at more apps popular amongst the notorious Gen. Z who were prime candidates for downloading our Emoji Party game. I examined colors schemes of apps like Vine, Snapchat, Instagram, and others before starting to explore the initial visual direction for the app. Here are some early color explorations to help determine the look and feel of the game.</h5>

          <h4 class="two columns offset-by-one column">Game Design</h4>

          <h5 class="eight columns">During the design phase our developer had been prototyping the experience in parallel so once we had the game mechanics down, it became quicker and quicker to iterate on both visual and interaction design. We spent a great deal of time making the sure the animations and transitions of the cards expanding and collapsing was just right, not to mention the Heads Up inspired interactions of flipping the phone up to pass and down to go to the next clue. </h5>

          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
           We also knew the importance of educating new users through the onboarding experience about how the game mechanics worked. For this, I was inspired by the popular monkey emojis in the default emoji set, however, because of their pixel density, I had to recreate them from scratch in Sketch and had to add arms that corresponded to the action we wanted to demonstrate. </h5>

          <h4 class="two columns offset-by-one column">AppleTV</h4>

          <h5 class="eight columns">Around the time we were planning on launching Emoji Party we got wind that Apple would releasing the SDK for its upcoming Apple TV update allowing a select group of studios and companies to build apps for the platform before it became public. Given our previous experience launching apps on the App Store we knew that if we had a complmenting app on the tvOS platform, it would give us a much bigger chance to land a feature and build buzz during launch. However, we didn't want to push our launch date so we had to design and develop an Apple TV app in 2 weeks.  </h5>

          <h5 class="eight columns offset-by-three column">
           I frantically started reading up on the interface guidelines Apple had put out and luckily it was all very well broken down. As always, I was blown away by the thought put into every little detail and the micro-interactions. Luckily, we were able to push ourselves to execute and launch successfully on both Apple TV and the iPhone App Stores. </h5>
